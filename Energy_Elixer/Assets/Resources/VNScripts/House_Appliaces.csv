5,Dialogue,4,6,Bulby,Have you ever heard about peak hours? We can save big if we avoid doing household chores during these times.,_,Bulby_main,_
6,Dialogue,5,7,Alex,Really? When are these peak hours?,John_Question,_,_
7,Dialogue,6,8,Bulby,Usually around 7pm. That's when everyone is home using lots of electricity for cooking heating and entertainment.,_,Bulby_main,_
8,Dialogue,7,9,Alex,So what can we do to save energy?,John_Question,_,_
9,Dialogue,8,10,Bulby,One simple trick is to shift our energy-intensive chores to off-peak times like late at night or early in the morning.,_,Bulby_main,_
10,Dialogue,9,11,Alex,How does that help Bulby?,John_Question,_,_
11,Dialogue,10,12,Bulby,During off-peak times fewer people use electricity so the demand is lower. This often means the cost of electricity is cheaper and it puts less strain on the power grid.,_,Bulby_main,_
12,Dialogue,11,13,Alex,That sounds great! Any other tips?,John_Question,_,_
13,Dialogue,12,14,Bulby,Oh there's plenty! But first take a look at the tasks ahead. Some are so obvious yet we often overlook them. I believe you can make the right decisions.,_,Bulby_main,_

35,Dialogue,31,36,Bulby,Great choice! Ironing all your clothes at once during an off-peak time saves both time and energy. You’ll see lower costs on your electricity bill and help reduce the strain on the power grid.,_,_,Bulby_Happy
36,Dialogue,35,37,Bulby,Ironing all your clothes at once is efficient but doing it during peak hours is not ideal. It will cost more due to higher electricity rates and adds extra strain to the power grid.,_,_,Bulby_main
37,Dialogue,36,38,Bulby,Ironing clothes every day might seem convenient but it’s actually the least energy-efficient option. Each session uses extra power and doing it during peak hours will cost more and increase the grid's load.,_,_,Bulby_sad

49,Dialogue,48,50,Bulby,Correct! Regularly cleaning or replacing the filters ensures the vacuum operates at optimal efficiency reducing energy consumption.,_,_,Bulby_Happy
50,Dialogue,49,51,Bulby,Not exactly. Using the right attachments for different surfaces actually helps the vacuum clean more effectively which can save energy.,_,_,Bulby_main
